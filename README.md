Nachos

Nachos is like meta git with GitHub awareness.

## Usage

You need to at least have your username in your git config:

    git config 

If you want the ability to sync your private repos, you should configure
your password as well:

    git config

Then, let it fly:

    nachos info
    # TDOO example output

    nachos sync
    # TODO example output

To change configuration, run the following:

    nachos setup 

This will write out a config file with some default values you can
override to ~/.nachos.yml.  Take a look at that file for the defaults
that are used normally.
